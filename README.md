Snake,Pong,SpaceInvader
The snake game is a shortest program, good for beginners in learning certain aspects of python which can be gained only through making games(i.e, experience)
Pong is a slightly better level but only difference is there are 2 controls , other than that its easy
Space invader is an entire package of game controls+adding images etc. the looping took a while for me to understand hehe
